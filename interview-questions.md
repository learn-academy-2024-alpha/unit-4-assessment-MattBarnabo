# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. JavaScript and Ruby are both backend languages
2. They both utilize built in methods to allow for easier coding
3. They both use objects, classes, and functions or methods.

Differences

1.Ruby has its own special terminal.
2.JavaScript requires more syntax to be used when writing code.
3. Ruby is written to be more human friendly and makes some of the difficult tasks in JavaScript into easy methods.

Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby are Higher languages making them easy for humans to understand, they are both intrepreted meaning they are read line by line from top to bottom, and they are both object oriented languages. JavaScript and Ruby also differ in ways such as Ruby is typically used for server side programming while JavaScript is typically used for user side programming in the creation of webpages, while they both are object oriented languages they differ in how they are modeled. Everything in Ruby is an object. Where as JavaScript has objects that contain key value pairs and are changable. Both languages have differing syntax and take there syntax from different languages. JavaScript's syntax stems from the C languages. While Ruby is based more on languages such as smalltalk, and perl.

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: Test Driven Development is where you write tests first, like pseudo coding, to test for different outcomes. Then developing the code to make those tests pass. Allowing you to avoid potential future bugs errors, and conflicts.

Researched answer: Commonly utilizing Red-Green_Refactor. Where you write a test then make sure your test fails in such a way that it fails because you haven't written the code not because the test itself has a problem. Then following a good failure the code is written to make sure the test passes. After the test passes you can go back to refactor and format making sure your code still passes the test.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is a section of code that allows you to write local pieces of logic.

Researched answer: Blocks are code that can be passed as an argument to a method. Like anonymous functions. They can be wrapped in {} for a single line of logic or do/end for multiple lines of logic.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: NVM and RVM are two common version managers. They manager mutliple versions of a programming language and other dependencies. They are great for managing versions when working on an older database or project where the current version of a software would create a conflict.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol is used to define how we send data back and forth between servers and web browswers on the World Wide Web. HTTP does not store information. Every request for info is independent. It uses URL's to as a location for stored information. Essentially like a file path and possibly containing a query.

2. Model validations: Model validation takes data stored within a model and checks a set of rules that are predefined to verify that the data makes the format of the database.

3. Params: Params are the parameters sent to HTTP, such as data from forms and queries. Key value pairs are used after a question mark in a URL. Params also exists within Ruby on Rails. It is similar to a hash and called params.
